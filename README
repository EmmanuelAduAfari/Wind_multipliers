This package is used to produce wind terrain and shielding multipliers.

Python 2.6, NumPy and SciPy are needed. ArcPy requiring ArcGIS 10 license is also needed.

The script for deriving terrain and shielding multipliers is terr_shield.py that consists of two modules: terrain and shielding.

Terrain module includes terrain_class2mz_orig.py and direction_filter.py. Shielding module includes dem_slope_aspect.py, terrain_class2ms_orig.py, direction_filter.py and combine.py.


Before running terr_shield.py to produce terrain and shielding multipliers, the configuration file named terr_shield.cfg needs to be configured. There are some variables to be pre-defined:

  root: the working directory of the task.
  loc_list: the location of the interest.
  cyclone_area: if the location is within the cyclone area, it is yes, otherwise it is no.
  ArcToolbox: the path of the ArcGIS tool box
  
Then copy the input files (dem and terrain classes) into the input folder (created beforehand manually) under root, and start to run terr_shield.py. The resutls are respectively located under output folder (created automatically during the process) under root.
